#### **What is a drip campaign?**

A Drip Campaign is a scheduled and structured flow of messages created for customer onboarding journeys. You can define which messages to be sent or can create the whole onboarding journey using the timeline-based messages and chat flow. It only applies to the new customers starting their conversation with the bot.

These drip campaigns can be used for creating a funnel and doing timely communication to your new customer to make them aware, act, and adopt your product or services.
