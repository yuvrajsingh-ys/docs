To begin using the live chat functionality, the agent must first be added as a member by the admin. The admin will provide the necessary credentials.

As soon as you log in to the page, you'll see the **"Go Online"** button on the left-hand side. You can enable or disable this button based on whether you want to be available for live chat.

### **Step 4:  Filtering Chats in the Inbox**

To make it easier to manage and prioritize chats, we have a **Filters** section in the inbox. You can filter out chats based on various criteria, such as:

- **Date & Time:** Filter chats by the date and time they were received.
- **Tags:** Choose specific tags to view chats related to particular categories, such as product inquiries, support, or sales.
- **Status:** Filter chats based on their status (e.g., Open, In Progress, Resolved).
- **Assigned Agent:** Filter chats to see those assigned to a specific team member.

This filtering functionality allows you to quickly narrow down and focus on specific chats that need attention, ensuring better organization and workflow.
