- The available "**Condition On**" options include:
  - **Visitor Response** – Based on the response given by the user to the chat message.
  - **Custom Attribute** – Evaluates the values of custom attributes created by the user.
  - **Contact Property** – Includes standard properties such as name, phone number, email, etc.
  - **Chat Property** – Considers chat-based properties such as tags, status, or weekday.
  - **Team Availability** – Checks whether a team member is currently available of a particular team.
  - **Business Hour Availability** – Determines if the chat occurs within predefined business hours as specified by user.
  - Conditions can be compared against **fixed values** using the following operators:
    - **Equals** (Exactly matches the given value)
    - **Not Equals** (Does not match the given value)
    - **Is Any Of** (Matches any value from a predefined list)
    - **Is Not Any Of** (Does not match any value from a predefined list)
  - The value for comparison is entered in the final input box, where users can also incorporate dynamic elements (e.g., user name) or custom attributes by using the **"/"** symbol.
  - Additionally, users can define OR conditions using the **"Add OR Condition"** option. This allows for multiple conditions to be evaluated, ensuring flexibility even if the first condition is false.
  - Finally, users must **select the next message** to determine the chatflow's progression after a condition is met.
