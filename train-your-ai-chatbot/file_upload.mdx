### **FAQ's:**

Here are some common FAQ's regarding upload of files:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does it take for the chatbot to start using my uploaded data?">
    Once your file or website data is uploaded, the system typically marks the training as "complete" within a few seconds to a couple of minutes. After that, your chatbot can start using the data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why does it say TRAINING COMPLETED but responses are still slow?">
    “Training complete” means the data has been processed and stored. However, depending on the AI model you’re using, it might still take a few minutes to generate smart responses based on that data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Which AI model gives the fastest responses after training?">
    The GPT-4o model is the fastest — it usually gives responses in under a minute. It’s ideal for speed and efficiency.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between ChatGPT-4o and the default Assistant in terms of response time?">
    GPT-4o responds almost instantly. The Assistant model (used by default) takes about **2–5 minutes** to fully reflect changes and provide optimized answers from the newly trained data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Which models should I use for best result with my uploaded content?">
    For the most accurate and stable responses based on your trained data, we recommend using the **Assistant model**, even though it may take slightly longer to respond.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many documents can I train my bot on?">
    There is essentially no limit on the number of documents you can train your bot on. It depends on the size of the document, your plan, and the time taken for the training.
