### **Why train the bot with FAQ's?**

You can teach your chatbot by adding **FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)**. Just write common questions your users might ask, and add clear answers. Group similar questions into categories to keep things organized. This helps your bot give faster and better answers. The more helpful questions you add, the smarter your bot becomes over time\!
