title: " How to configure your chatbot's personality"
description: "Utilize chatbot scenarios to respond to user inputs using pre-defined messages, or redirect them to different flows using the power of artificial intelligence"
---

The inputs of users are varying, but certain inputs, such as those which the chatbot cannot provide an answer to, or those that may be offensive, can be configured to give a pre-defined response. This is done through the use of AI, which analyses the input to understand its intent, and responds back with the correct pre-defined response.   Additionally, for better organization, you can have different flows. Utilizing the power of artificial intelligence, we can use flow redirection to analyze the users input, and then redirect them to the appropriate flow at any time.

### **Steps for Setup of Dynamic Chatflow Configuration:**

1. Login to your  Convertalk account and select the desired bot in the dashboard.
2. Click on “Website Chatbot Settings”.

7. Complete the form with the relevant details for the bot. The fields to fill are as follows:
   - **Name**: Specify the name of the chat. This name will be the primary description of the trigger. E.g.: “Flowers” for redirection to flowers chat
   - **Trigger**: Define the action to be executed when the specified condition is met. Options include triggering a specific message or an entire chat flow.
     - **Message**: Enter the message to be displayed in the chat.
     - **Flow**: Select the chat flow to be triggered.
   - Based on the previous Trigger input:
     - **Message**: Enter the message that is to be displayed when triggered. Eg. If the message is offensive, the response message can be "I am not quite used to this language".
     - **Flow**: Select the flow onto which the chat should be redirected to.

#### **Still Not Working? Let's Troubleshoot**

If the chat is not responding as expected, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Verify Triggers and Conditions**: Ensure that the trigger conditions are correctly set and aligned with the intended message types or user inputs.
2. **Check Message and Flow Settings**: Confirm that the correct message or chat flow is selected and configured properly.
