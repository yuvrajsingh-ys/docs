Meta Business Accounts, now called Business Portfolios, are essential for managing ad campaigns, Facebook Pages, and Business Manager operations. However, due to policy violations, security triggers, or suspicious activity, your Meta account (or one of its assets) may get restricted or disabled. This document guides you through identifying, appealing, and recovering access where possible.

### **Why Meta Account Restrictions Happen:**

1. Policy Violations: Breaching Meta's Advertising, Community, or Commerce Policies.
2. Suspicious Activity: Irregular login attempts, IP changes, or bot-like behavior.
3. Unverified Business Information: Missing or incomplete domain and business verification.
4. Negative User Feedback: Poor ad relevance scores, repeated reports, or engagement bait.
5. Linked Account Penalties: Associations with previously banned or restricted accounts.
6. Fraudulent Payment Methods: Use of flagged or inconsistent billing information.
7. Repeated Offenses: Multiple prior warnings or restrictions ignored.

### **FAQ's:**

Here are some frequently asked questions regrading getting disabled/restricted accounts from Meta.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does meta take to respond to a review request?">
    Meta usually responds within **24–72 hours**, though in some cases, especially if additional documentation is needed, it may take longer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I don't see the 'request review' button. What should I do?">
    If the "Request Review" option is missing, it typically means:

    - The account is **not eligible for review**.
    - The issue has already been reviewed and closed.
    - The restriction is **permanent** due to severe policy violations.

    In such cases, refer to the "If Review Option is Not Available" section of this guide for alternatives.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I appeal using different admin account?">
    Yes, if you have **multiple verified admins**, another admin may attempt to raise the request or contact support. Ensure the admin has **sufficient access level** in the Business Portfolio.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if my entire business portfolio is restricted?">
    If your full Portfolio is restricted:

    - All linked assets (Ad Accounts, Pages, WhatsApp Numbers) will be affected.
    - You'll need to identify if the restriction is on the Portfolio or individual assets.
    - If eligible, raise a review for the Portfolio itself under **Account Overview**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What should I incude in the request review form?">
    - A **clear, concise justification** explaining that the restriction may be in error.
    - Evidence of compliance with Meta's policies (e.g., verified domain, legitimate ad usage).
    - Mention any **corrective steps** you've already taken.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will deleting and recreating my accounts solve the issue?">
    No. Meta tracks behavior at multiple levels—**user, business, device, IP, and payment profile**. Simply creating a new account without resolving the root issue often results in further restrictions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I prevent restrictions in the future?">
    Yes. Follow all the **Best Practices** outlined in this guide—especially:

    - Business verification
    - 2FA security
    - Clean payment history
    - Clear policy-compliant ad content
