 Convertalk to the Plivo’s **Name **field in the leads. Similarly, in order for integration to work properly, you will require to map all other questions/ components of your Bot to Plivo fields.

You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Convertalk dashboard as well as in the Plivo you have integrated.

### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead from your Bot to Plivo, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials such as API Token, API key, and/or URL has been entered correctly.
- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Convertalk Question and CRM parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Convertalk as integration works only in paid plan.
