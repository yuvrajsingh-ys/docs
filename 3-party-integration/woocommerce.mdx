Once you have established a connection between ** Convertalk** and **the WooCommerce website, you are ready** for your first test lead. You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Convertalk dashboard as well as in the WhatsApp chatbot sent messages.

#### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials such as API Token, API key, and/or URL has been entered correctly.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Convertalk as integration works only in paid plan.
