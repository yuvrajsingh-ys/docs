### **Step 3 of 4: Set up Mapping Parameters**

1. Now, you need to map **parameters (fields) of Google Sheets** to the user response of the  Convertalk question. In other words, you need to map the questions or custom attributes that will be saved to the Google Sheet. The fields that need to be entered are:
   - **Title**: This is the title of the spreadsheet that you wish to create.
   - **Select a Default Sheet**: Select in which you want the information to go to.
   - **Select a Default Sub-Sheet:** Select the tab/sub-sheet in which the information will be mapped.
   - **Map Questions:** Map the questions in the chatflow we wish to be stored in the spreadsheet.
   - **Custom Attributes**: If the chat has custom attributes, we can utilize them to store values over in spreadsheet.

<Warning>
  Make sure you have a empty sheet made in your google sheet account, so it can be connect to  Convertalk.
</Warning>

You can use the **\+Add Parameters** button to add more fields.

For example, you select a question: Please provide your name?. Then, you map it with the parameter -Name. As a result, this mapping will enable integration to send the user's response from  Convertalk to the Google Sheet’s \*\*Name \*\*field in the leads. Similarly, in order for integration to work properly, you will require to map all other questions/ components of your Bot to Google Sheets fields.

<Info>
  Please note that these queries/questions options will be auto fetched from your bot chat flow, so, make sure you configure your chat flow first.

3. To test the integration, proceed to install the bot. Click on the top right "**Install**" button and go over to W3 schools, where we can run the copied code. This will show that the code has been copied and

### **Step 4 of 4: Test your Integration Set up with Data**

Once you have established a connection between Convertalk and **Google Sheets**, and the mapping is complete, you are ready to go for your first test lead. You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Convertalk dashboard as well as in the Google Sheets you have integrated.

### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead from your Bot to Google Sheets, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Convertalk Question and App parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Convertalk as integration works only in paid plan.
