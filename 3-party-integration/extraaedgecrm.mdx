### **Step 1 of 5: Login to  Convertalk Account and Select Application to Integrate**

a. Login to your  Convertalk account. Now, select and click the Bot you want to integrate

with Extraaedge CRM. Click on the ‘Integrate tab.’

b. The Integrate Window Will Open up. Select the ‘All Integrations’ Tab.

c. A list of all native integrations for  Convertalk will be available in this window.

d. Now find Extraaedge CRM by:-

- Either by scrolling down the list or,
- by typing **‘Extraaedge’** in the Search Box with the placeholder “Search Integration By Name”

e. Now Click On The **‘Connect’** Button As Shown

f. An Interface, as shown below, will open up. Here, you will be asked to enter

- Authorization Token
- Source

that you will get by logging into your Extraaedge account.

### **Step 2 of 5: Find your Authorization Key/Token in App Account**

To get the Authorization Token, go to [extraaedge.com](http://extraaedge.com) and request them for Demo setup after submitting your details. Extraaedge will mail you the Demo Setup and provide the Authorization Token and Source for integration set up..

### **Step 3 of 5: Enter Authorization Details and establish connection with your App**

a. Enter Extraaedge Authorization Token and Source, and click the ‘Connect’ Button to

complete integration of  Convertalk with Extraaedge CRM.

b. If you have entered all the details correctly, you will see a notification that says,

“**Integrated Successfully.”**

### **Step 4 of 5: Set up Mapping Parameters**

a. Now, as connection of the  Convertalk and Extraaedge is established, you need

to map **parameters (fields) of Extraaedge** to the user response of the  Convertalk question.

You can use the **\+Add Parameters** button to add more fields.

For example, you select a question from All bot questions/components: Please provide your name?

Then, you map it with the parameter -Name

As a result, this mapping will enable integration to send the user's response from

Convertalk to the Extraaedge’s Name field in the leads. Similarly, in order for integration to work properly, you will require to map all other questions/ components of your Bot to Extraaedge fields.

Please note that these queries/questions options will be auto fetched from your bot chat flow, So, make sure you configure your chat flow first.

b. If you have entered all the details correctly, you will see a notification that says,

“**Mapping successfully.**

c. Also, your Extraaedge CRM integration will show the message Installed in the

Integration List.

### **Step 5 of 5: Test your Integration Set up with Data**

Once you have established a connection between Convertalk and **Extraaedge**, and the mapping is complete, you are ready to go for your first test lead. You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Convertalk dashboard as well as in the Extraaedge you have integrated.

### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead from your Bot to Extraaedge, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials such as API Token, API key, and/or URL has been entered correctly.
- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Convertalk Question and App parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Convertalk as integration works only in paid plan.
