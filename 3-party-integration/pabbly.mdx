### **What is Pabbly?**

Pabbly is an automation tool that connects different apps and services, allowing them to work together without manual effort. It helps users automate tasks by setting up workflows that run automatically.

### **What are Triggers?**

A trigger is an event that starts an automation. For example, when a new lead is captured on  Convertalk, that event can trigger an action in another app. Triggers tell Pabbly when to start a workflow.

### **What are Actions?**

An action is what happens after a trigger. Once a trigger occurs, Pabbly communicates the assigned action to the end application, like sending lead data to Google Sheets or notifying a team on Slack. Actions complete the automation process.

### **How Pabbly Helps with  Convertalk**

Integrating Pabbly with  Convertalk allows businesses to automate workflows and enhance chatbot efficiency. When a **new contact is created**, a **message is received in chat**, or a **WhatsApp order is placed**, these triggers can initiate automated actions in other applications. Similarly, when triggered by a third-party app through Pabbly,  Convertalk can **send WhatsApp templates, update custom attributes, send session messages, or add new contacts**. This seamless automation reduces manual work, improves response time, and ensures smooth communication across platforms.

### **Prerequisites**

The following prerequisites need to be met when you are integrating Pabbly with  Convertalk.

- An active Pabbly account with available **task credits** for automation processes.
