### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy leads from your Bot to Salesflare it may be due to multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You need to check and see if all the authorization credentials, such as API Token, API key, and URL, have been entered correctly.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Convertalk, as integration works only with the paid plan.
