**Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy leads from your Bot to Salesforce CRM, it may be due to multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials such as Domain, Client ID and Client Secret have been entered correctly.
- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Convertalk Question and CRM parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Convertalk as integration works only in paid plan.
