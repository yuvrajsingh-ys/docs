### **Step 4 of 5: Set up Mapping Parameters**

1. Now, as the connection of the  Convertalk and SendInBlue is established, you need to map **parameters (fields) of SendInBlue** to the user response of the  Convertalk question/queries.

You can use the **\+Add Parameters** button to add more fields.

For example, you select a question from Bot questions/components: Please provide your name?

Then, you map it with the parameter -Name

As a result, this mapping will enable integration to send the user's response from  Convertalk to the SendInBlue App’s \*\*Name \*\*field in the leads. Similarly, in order for integration to work properly, you will require to map all other questions/ components of your Bot to SendInBlue App fields.

Please note that these queries/questions options will be auto fetched from your bot chat flow, So, make sure you configure your chat flow first.

   c. Also, your SendInBlue CRM integration will show the message \*\*Installed \*\*in the

   Integration List.

### **Step 5 of 5: Test your Integration Set up with Data**

Once you have established a connection between \*\* Convertalk\*\* and **SendInBlue** and the mapping is complete, you are ready to go for your first test lead. You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Convertalk dashboard as well as in the SendInBlue that you have integrated.

### **Still Not working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead from your Bot to CRM, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials such as Token, API key, URLMetc has been entered correctly.
- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Convertalk Question and 3rd App parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Convertalk as integration works only in paid plan.
