### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead from your Bot to Google Task, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Convertalk Question and App parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Convertalk as integration works only in paid plan.
