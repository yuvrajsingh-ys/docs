### **What is the Roles Section?**

The **Roles** section allows administrators to create custom permission sets that define what team members can view, modify, or delete across different areas of the Convertalk platform. This helps enforce access control, data security, and workflow governance within your organization.

- **Read:** It grants users access to only view the selected section.
- **Write:** It grants users access to make changes in the selected section.
- **Delete:** It allows users to delete existing items within the selected section.

Let's illustrate this with an example in the **Inbox —\> Chats** section:

- **Read Access**: Users can view all chats across all chatbots but cannot edit or delete them.
- **Write Access**: Users can view and edit any chat across all chatbots but cannot delete them.
- **Delete Access**: Users can view and delete any chat across all chatbots but cannot edit them.

After giving the necessary permissions, proceed by clicking on **"Create Role"** located at the bottom.

- **Status:** If the status of a role is **"active"**, it can be assigned to any team member. If the role is **“inactive”**, it cannot be assigned to anyone.
- **Action:** You can **edit** or **delete** any of the existing roles from here.
