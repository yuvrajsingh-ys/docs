  <Accordion title="How and when your conversation limits in WhatsApp will increase?">
    Each time you initiate a new conversation with a unique customer Meta will determine if your limit should be increased. This determination is based on the following criteria:

    - your phone number status is **Connected**
    - your phone number quality rating is **Medium** or **High**
    - in the last 7 days, you have initiated X or more conversations with unique customers, where X is your current messaging limit divided by 2

    If you meet all conditions, we will increase your messaging limit by one level in 24 hours.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How to check meta conversation limit">
    You can check your current messaging limits in the **WhatsApp Manager** \> **Overview Dashboard** \> **Insights** tab. The panel depicted below will only show your current limit if your messaging limit has increased from the default limit of 250.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the phone number quality rating and how does it affect my messaging limit?">
    The phone number quality rating is a measure of your phone number's reliability and trustworthiness when initiating conversations with customers. If your phone number has been flagged in the last 7 days, Meta will immediately decrease your messaging limit by one level. This means you will have a reduced capacity to initiate new conversations with unique customers.
