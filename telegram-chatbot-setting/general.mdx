The **General** section allows you to configure core interaction settings for your Telegram chatbot. Below are the fields and their functionalities:

1. **Session Timeout**
   - Define the time limit after which the chat session will automatically end if the user does not respond to the bot's messages.
2. **Restart Chat Keywords**
   - Specify keywords to restart the chat. For example, entering "restart" will trigger a new chat session. Multiple keywords can be added.
3. **Live Chat Expiry**
   - Set a time limit for live chat requests. If no agent accepts the request within this time, the live chat request will expire.
4. **Live Chat Request Keywords**
   - Add keywords to initiate a live chat request. For instance, typing "live agent" will request live agent support.
5. **Unavailability Message**
   - Customize the message shown when live chat support is unavailable. Example: "Live chat is currently unavailable. Sorry for the inconvenience."
6. **Completion Message**
   - Provide a message that appears when a chat session concludes. This can include instructions for restarting or requesting live chat again.
7. **User Inactivity Message**
   - Configure a message to prompt the user when there is no activity. Example: "It seems you haven't responded. Please reply to continue."
