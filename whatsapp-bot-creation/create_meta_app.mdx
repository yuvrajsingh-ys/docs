Before you start,

- You must be logged into your [Facebook developer account](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/register).
- Ensure you have not exceeded your app limit. As a Developer, you are permitted to have a developer or administrator role on a maximum of 15 apps. If you have reached the app limit and are unable to create an application or accept a new pending role, take the following steps:
  - Visit your [My Apps](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/) page to remove any apps you no longer use. You can [remove](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/app-dashboard/app-states/#removing-apps) an app entirely or resign your role as an administrator or developer from the app.

### **Step 1: Start the app creation process**

If you just came from the registration flow, click the **Create First App** button. Otherwise, go to the [Apps](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) panel and click Create App.

### **Step 2: Choose a use case**

Select the use case as "**Other**"

### **Step 4. Set your app name and email**

Enter the name of your app and an email address where we can send you any important developer notifications. The email address can be different from the email address associated with your Facebook account.

Once you have completed the app creation flow your app will be loaded in the App Dashboard.
