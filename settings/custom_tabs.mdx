## **What are Custom Tabs?**

The “tabs” currently present in  Convertalk refer to the tabs on the left-hand sidebar of the main  Convertalk dashboard. These include tabs such as Home, Bots, Inbox, Analytics, etc, and they help users in traversing the  Convertalk platform, utilizing all the available features through a super-easy navigation sidebar.

The new “Custom Tabs” feature is designed to enhance platform functionality by allowing customers to add and connect their own websites as tabs within  Convertalk. This enables a more personalized workspace, streamlining workflows and improving efficiency. This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to create and utilize “Custom Tabs.”

1. Login to your  Convertalk Dashboard, and open the collapsible menu on the left-hand sidebar.
2. Click on the “**More**” tab, which will open up the Collapsible menu.
